This program will take a text file containing the lyrics of a song and output
the frequency of each word to a chart showing the most common words and their
frequencies. 

To use, you will need matplotlib. Then just use the command:

	python lyricFreq.py < song_text_file.txt

Where song_text_file.txt is just some text file containing the lyrics of the
song that you want to analyze. The chart will output the top 10 lyrics by
default, but this can be changed by changing the NUMLYRICS constant in the
lyricFreq.py file.
